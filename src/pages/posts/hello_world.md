# hello_world

Welcome to my blog! Here, I will share my journey as I learn how to code.

## What I've done before

1. **👨‍🍳 cooking**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **👔  banking & consulting**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **🚀  investing & shipping**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
