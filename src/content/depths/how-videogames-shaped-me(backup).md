I was born as Divesh Punjabi in Panama. As the son of Indian-Colombian immigrants, I had a hard time choosing my identity - it was hard to relate with my Indian friends from the diaspora in Panama, but also to my Panamanian friends from the Catholic school I attended. And of course, religion didn't help much.

I was a shy kid, didn't have many friends, and wasn't sure how to fit in.

**But I was also curious, and a bit of a nerd.**

I grew up fascinated by video games. But my older brother kept bullying me when I was too young to comprehend what was happening in the NES and SNES games we played. He kept shouting that he beat me, and I just never got it. I just wanted to have fun, he just wanted to win.

Ocarina of Time was where I sought out fun, and my first obsession with a world outside of my own. I was fascinated by its vastness and I just couldn't drop it until I explored every corner - it satisfied my curiosity. Whenever I faced difficulties, I browsed [GameFAQs](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/n64/197771-the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/faqs/44785) (and [babelfish](https://www.babelfish.com/) as a non-native English speaker) to find clues on what to try next and how to (exhaustively) beat the game.

**More than anything, it taught me how to seek answers for myself.**

My brother and I were now obsessed with SSMB Melee on GameCube. His Captain Falcon and Marth were extremely good (and annoying...), and I just couldn't find a way to beat him. It wasn't until I started finding my own answers online that I realized I could beat him if I was deliberate.

I picked up Fox McCloud ðŸ¦Š, learned the Wave Dash, and became a master of Down+B (i.e., [the annoying shield trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXpQ9-TRop4)). You'd now see me jumping & dashing throughout the map and shielding him out of it every single match - fearless, confident, free. I stopped playing his game, and started playing my own. I was invincible.

**I learned the value of deliberate practice.**

I built my first computer around the age of 10. The internet said building your own was a good idea - and so I did. My new obsession became Counter Strike 1.5, and then eventually 1.6.

I started playing competitively immediately, joining teams of people 5-10 years older than me. And I quickly became better than them. But this game was team-based, and I had a hard time finding the right people to play with in Panama. On one end, I was too young and immature - so no one wanted to play with me. On the other, no one took the game as seriously as I did.

But I wanted to compete at the highest levels. So I started watching videos like [Frag or Die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ylWONP4Y7A) and *demos* to learn how the best in the world played. I had a hard time accepting that being from Panama meant I couldn't compete...

I grinded CAL/CPL leagues and ESEA for a while. But eventually, I realized that finding 4 likeminded people was almost impossible, and joining a US team was equally challenging (given my 150+ ms vs. their ~10ms), so I turned to a game where you could grind solo and find like-minded people at the top.

**I learned the value of solitude.**

I picked up vanilla WoW and chose a mighty Paladin as my first class. I didn't like it much at the start as I was used to the fast pace of FPS games, and Pallys were just a support class with a shiny-looking armor. Instead, I helped my brother level up his Fury Warrior, and eventually helped him get ready for his 40-man MC and AQ raids - it was magical.

I wasn't the one playing the game. I was supporting my brother in playing the game. It wasn't until Burning Crusade that I realized that I could be the one playing the game. And so I looked up for the most competitive PvE Realm (i.e., those that cleared new dungeons the fastest), created a Warlock there, and leveled it up to 70.

Then the real game began - endgame. This involved grinding dungeons for hours praying to the RNG-gods to drop the gear to get you past the item level threshold for the next tier.

**I learned I was the only thing holding me back.**

Eventually, I needed a real life. Friends, a social life, dates. You know, the usual. But this just doesn't go well with trying to be #1 at WoW. And so I switched to League of Legends during its beta days.

LoL offered something no other game did. It gave room to solo players despite being team-based, and somehow they created this magical experience where my 150+ ms was gone. I could compete now.

I grinded solo but I needed a team. Just like CS 1.6, I made a team with the best players in Panama. Somehow, we made it to the finals at a ranked league and played against Team SoloMid. I feared no one, chose my Ezreal, and played like it was just another game.

We lost and ended 1-15 in K-D. But I ended 1-0. I was capable.

**Then, I repurposed my skills.**

Back in the day Twitch was just getting started with HotshotGG and CLG. So gaming was just not a choice to make a living. I still don't think it is.

Since then, I've been looking to play at the same competitive levels as I did in WoW. I didn't find that in VC, consulting, or banking. But I have seen it in the best founding teams.

And so I've decided to solo this mf. But I know the value of teamwork:
