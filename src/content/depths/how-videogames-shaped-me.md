I was born in Panama as Divesh Punjabi. As the son of Indian-Colombian immigrants, I had a hard time choosing my identity - it was hard to relate with my Indian friends from the diaspora in Panama, but also to my Panamanian friends from the Catholic school I attended. And of course, religion didn't help much.

I was a shy kid, didn't have many friends, and wasn't sure how to fit in.

**But I was also curious, and a bit of a nerd.**

I grew up fascinated by video games. It started with my older brother getting his first Nintendo console over one Christmas. We kept playing all the games possible on NES and SNES, especially the ones where he could beat me, being 5 years older than me it was mostly every game. I was enchanted by seeing imagination translated into pixels and sounds.

Ocarina of Time was where I sought out fun, and my first obsession with a world outside of my own. I was fascinated by its vastness and I just couldn't drop it until I explored every corner - it satisfied my curiosity. Whenever I faced difficulties, I browsed [GameFAQs](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/n64/197771-the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/faqs/44785) (and [babelfish](https://www.babelfish.com/) as a non-native English speaker) to find clues on what to try next and how to (exhaustively) beat the game.

**More than anything, it taught me how to seek answers for myself.**

My brother and I were now obsessed with SSMB Melee on GameCube. His Captain Falcon and Marth were extremely good (and annoying...), and I just couldn't find a way to beat him. It wasn't until I started finding my own answers online that I realized I could beat him if I was deliberate.

I picked up Fox McCloud ðŸ¦Š, learned the [Wave Dash](https://youtu.be/_EcPgWGiEhk?si=fuJRzBD7LEzKs_e3), and became a master of Down+B (i.e., [the annoying shield trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXpQ9-TRop4)). You'd now see me jumping & dashing throughout the map and shielding him out of it every single match - fearless, confident, free. I stopped playing his game, and started playing my own. I was invincible.

**I learned the value of deliberate practice.**

I built my first computer around the age of 10. The internet said building your own was a good idea - and so I did. My new obsession became Counter Strike 1.5, and then eventually 1.6.

I started playing competitively immediately, joining teams of people 5-10 years older than me. And I quickly became better than them. But this game was team-based, and I had a hard time finding the right people to play with in Panama. On one end, I was too young and immature - so no one wanted to play with me. On the other, no one took the game as seriously as I did.

But I wanted to compete at the highest levels. So I started watching videos like [Frag or Die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ylWONP4Y7A) and *demos* to learn how the best in the world played. I had a hard time accepting that being from Panama meant I couldn't compete...

I grinded CAL/CPL leagues and ESEA for a while. But eventually, I realized that finding 4 likeminded people was almost impossible, and joining a US team was equally challenging (given my 150+ ms vs. their ~10ms), so I turned to a game where you could grind solo from the bottom and find like-minded people at the top.

**I learned the value of solitude.**

I picked up vanilla WoW and chose a mighty Paladin as my first class. I didn't like it much at the start as I was used to the fast pace of FPS games, and Pallys were just a support class with a shiny-looking armor. Instead, I helped my brother level up his Fury Warrior, and eventually helped him get ready for his 40-man MC and AQ raids - it was magical.

But I didn't have my own character, so I wasn't the one playing the game, I was supporting my brother. It wasn't until Burning Crusade that I realized it was my time to compete. And so I looked up for the most competitive PvE Realm (i.e., those looking to clear new dungeons the fastest), created a Warlock there, and leveled it up to 70.

Then the real game began - endgame. This involved grinding dungeons for hours praying to the RNG gods to drop the gear to get you past the item level threshold for the next tier.

**I learned I was the only thing holding me back.**

Eventually, I needed a real life. Friends, a social life, dates. You know, the usual. But this just doesn't go well with trying to be #1 at WoW. And so I switched to League of Legends during its beta days.

LoL offered something no other game did. It gave room to solo players despite being team-based, and somehow they created this magical experience where my 150+ ms was gone. I could compete now.

I grinded solo but I needed a team. Just like CS 1.6, I made a team with the best players in Panama. Somehow, we made it to the finals at a ranked league and played against Team SoloMid. I feared no one, chose my Ezreal, and played like it was just another game.

We lost and ended 1-15 in K-D. But I ended 1-0. I was capable.

**Then, I repurposed my skills.**

Back in the day Twitch was just getting started with HotshotGG and CLG. So gaming was just not a choice to make a living. I still don't think it is.

Since then, I've been looking to play at the same competitive levels as I did in WoW. I didn't find that in VC, consulting, or banking. But I have seen it in the best founding teams.

And so I've decided to solo this mf. But I know the value of teamwork:

**So then I asked myself: how hard can it be?**

It finally hit me. I created my own MUGEN worlds as 10-year old, modded Garry's Mod and CS with surf maps, augmented & extended my abilties with WoW, and then just played the game with Lol.

As a solo kid in Panama with no one around speaking the same language I was left to figure things out, and so I did.

And so like my friend Jensen Huang once said: _how hard can it be?*
