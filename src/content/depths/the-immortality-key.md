In late 2021 during the Covid-binge, I randomly stumbled upon an [interview by Jordan Peterson with Brian Muraresku](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c-bWymbT04), the author of The Immortality Key. One of his key points was that the ancient greek performed a sacred ritual known as the [Eleusinian Mysteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleusinian_Mysteries), which he hypothesized involved the consumption of psychedelics.

About a year later as I was starting business school I decided to finally read [Meditations](https://www.amazon.com/Meditations-New-Translation-Marcus-Aurelius/dp/0812968255) by Marcus Aurelius (t. by Gregory Hayes). As I explored how Marcus conceived and expressed his ideas, I couldn't stop sensing he had definitely tried shrooms.

Both these events led me to naturally get a copy of The Immortality Key. After going through the first few chapters, I found out that Marcus Aurelius was one of the few romans to ever participate in this greek sacrament. Apparently, his mother was one of the most powerful women in ancient Greece, granting him access to the sacred rituals.

The ritual started with a piligrimage from the Athenian Agora, specifically the [stoic painted porch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoa_Poikile). Its hard to ignore these connections. However, regardless of whether you believe these connections are meaningful or not, I think the underlying philosophy behind this and other ancient rituals is extremely valuable.
